# NVelocity

## Introduction

I needed a template engine similar to the Apache Velocity project and came across [NVelocity](https://github.com/castleproject/MonoRail) from
the Castle Project Monorail. Instead of forking the whole tree, I have made a new full fork of my own. As it's Apache licensed,
I hope I'm not in violation of anything but I'm not a lawyer.

## Information

This build is for .NET Core 2 and is used very lightly. I've included a few unit tests of interest to myself, but they are by
no means extensive. I have not yet (and might not) included the stock unit tests and am implementing only what I consider
a means of verifying I actually can make NVelocity work.

I have no intention of supporting this project and will likely move to an alternative system instead.
